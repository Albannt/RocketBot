# RocketBot
### Notes
This app is very proprietary and a couple years old. I took the chance to refactor it a bit recently, but there's still a ton of work to be done and documented
## Setup
- Make a copy of `config_example.py` and rename it to `config.py`, then fill it in with your own environment constants
- Do the same thing with `txtData_example.json`, but don't change the file contents
- Run through all files and read comments detailing what changes what, proper documentation TBA (?)
## Startup
run `main.py`
